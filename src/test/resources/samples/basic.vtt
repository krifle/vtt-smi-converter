NOTE
This file was written by Jill. I hope
you enjoy reading it. Some things to
bear in mind:
- I was lip-reading, so the cues may
not be 100% accurate
- I didn’t pay too close attention to
when the cues should start or end.

<v Roger Bingham>We’re actually at the Lucern Hotel, just down the street
